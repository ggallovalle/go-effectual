Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>"

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks

3. **Get apply instructions**
   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID → array of concrete file paths
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles`:
   - proposal.typ
   - design.typ
   - specs/*.typ
   - tasks.typ

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Update task checkbox: `task-unchecked` → `task-checked`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

All tasks complete! Ready to archive this change.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names
- When updating task checkboxes in tasks.typ, use `task-checked()` function
